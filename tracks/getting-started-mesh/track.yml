  # Red Hat Ansible automation mesh
  ***

  <br>

  The [**automation mesh**](https://www.ansible.com/blog/whats-new-in-ansible-automation-platform-2.1-automation-mesh) component of Ansible Automation Platform is a multi-directional, multi-hopped overlay network of nodes delivering automation across constrained networks, such as DMZs and VPCs, to local and remote endpoints across the globe.

  Automation mesh introduces new features that remove dependencies on ancillary tools such as jump hosts and SSH proxies by localizing automation with a security-first approach.

  This lab covers:

  * Automation mesh node types and features
  * How to use automation controller logically group execution capacity
  * Using automation mesh in multi-site environments
  * Building redundancy into your automation mesh design
