## Your assignment
### *Estimated time: 10 minutes*

[**Instance groups**](https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/latest/html/administration/containers_instance_groups.html) logically arrange execution capacity and provide control on where an automation job runs. Instance groups are then assigned with **automation controller** objects, such as Inventories, Organizations and Job Templates.

Automation mesh worker nodes are associated with **instance groups** enabling you to allocate the desired execution capacity and location for your platform.

**Create a new instance group for Raleigh data center**
<br>

Automation controller is deployed in the Raleigh data center and we want to run our automation jobs locally using the **automation-controller21 hybrid node**.
<br>

* On the side navigation under the **Administration** section, click on **Instance Groups**
* Click on the **Add** and select **Add instance group**
* Create a new instance group and name it `Raleigh data center`.
* Click on **Save**

<br>

**Associate the `automation-controller21` instance with the **Raleigh data center** instance group**
* Click on **Instances** on the top menu.
* Click on **Associate**
* Select the `automation-controller21` instance and click on **Save**

<br>

**Create a new instance group for Johannesburg data center**
<br>

We also need to run automation jobs in Johannesburg, South Africa. To do this, we'll create a new instance group and associate the **mesh-exec1 execution node** which is deployed in the data center.
<br>

* On the side navigation under the **Administration** section, click on **Instance Groups**
* Click on the **Add** and select **Add instance group**
* Create a new instance group and name it `Johannesburg data center`.
* Click on **Save**

<br>

**Associate the `mesh-exec1` instance with the **Johannesburg data center** instance group**
* Click on **Instances** on the top menu.
* Click on **Associate**
* Select the `mesh-exec1` instance and click on **Save**

<br>

**Worker node health checks**
<br>

Automation mesh performs health checks on worker nodes to determine the optimal route and automation job allocation. Let's run a health check on `mesh-exec1` in Johannesburg.
<br>

* On the side navigation under the **Administration** section, click on **Instance Groups**
* Click on the `Johannesburg data center` instance group
* Click on **Instances** on the top menu.
* Select `mesh-exec1` by clicking on the checkbox next it
* Click on **Health Check**
* Hover your mouse over the `Healthy` under the **Status** column and note the day/time.‚Äù
